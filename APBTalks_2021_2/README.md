**Highlight:**
Our second APBioNETTalks, which was a demo, took place on January 9, 2021 entitled “Structural Phylogenetics” and was delivered by Dr. Ashar Malik of Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR, Singapore.

The session provided a comprehensive yet accessible overview on sequence and structural phylogenetics. Dr. Ashar covered various topics under the theme, including pipelines and tools to use for performing evolutionary analysis, different kinds of statistical methods and phylogenetic tree generation approaches. He also provided a quick demo on how to utilize the command line interface for structure and sequence comparisons, as well as for tree generation.

The talk was live-streamed on APBioNET YouTube channel and is also available for later viewing, in case you could not attend the talk or would like to revisit or share it with others: [https://youtu.be/yQZA47jiI3s](https://youtu.be/yQZA47jiI3s).
