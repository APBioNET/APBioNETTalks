## **Welcome to APBioNETTalks!** 
This is a community initiative brought to you by Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNET). It aims to provide an online avenue to showcase bioinformatics related talks, tutorials, and training. The program aims to make the learning of bioinformatics more engaging, inclusive and accessible. We will invite experts, early career researchers/scientists, and Ph.D. students to share their knowledge and skills. If you are interested to contribute, do get in touch with us. The videos will be live-streamed and be made available for later viewing. This materials will serve as an open bioinformatics resource for the community. In the process, we hope to promote the discovery and sharing of bioinformatics. Video-based learning resources for bioinformatics are still scarce. Some of them are not available in English. If available, they are not free. Even if they are free, they usually only cover the introduction aspects, with very basic discussions. Most of the specific and intermediate-to-advanced discussions or skills are usually not available. This hampers the learning of bioinformatics in solving complex biological problems. Through APBioNETTalks, we hope to contribute to bridge this gap by providing an open access video-based bioinformatics learning resources for the community.

## *Upcoming Activities*

### Sugars in the cloud: Machine learning and data science for glycobiology
**September 21, 2022, 5pm (SGT)**

***Dr. Daniel Bojar, University of Gothenburg, Sweden***

Glycans or complex carbohydrates are a universal yet understudied biological sequence with unique properties. The crucial role of glycans in autoimmunity, viral infections, cancer, microbiome development, and many other processes holds promise for translating a better understanding of glycan functions into biomedical advances. Dr. Bojar will present the efforts of his research group to achieve this. Developing and applying data science and machine learning methods for glycobiology has, among others, provided insight into glycan - protein interactions, glycan - immune interactions, and glycan - pathogen interactions. In a two-pronged approach, Dr. Bojar's group both uses new methods to discover these new facets of glycobiolgoy but also makes these methods freely available to the community via their Python package glycowork, to build a firm foundation for computational glycobiology.
