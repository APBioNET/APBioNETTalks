## **Welcome to APBioNetTalks!** 
This is a community initiative brought to you by Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet). It aims to provide an online avenue to showcase bioinformatics related talks, tutorials, and training. The program aims to make the learning of bioinformatics more engaging, inclusive and accessible. We will invite experts, early career researchers/scientists, and Ph.D. students to share their knowledge and skills. If you are interested to contribute, do get in touch with us. The videos will be live-streamed and be made available for later viewing. This materials will serve as an open bioinformatics resource for the community. In the process, we hope to promote the discovery and sharing of bioinformatics. Video-based learning resources for bioinformatics are still scarce. Some of them are not available in English. If available, they are not free. Even if they are free, they usually only cover the introduction aspects, with very basic discussions. Most of the specific and intermediate-to-advanced discussions or skills are usually not available. This hampers the learning of bioinformatics in solving complex biological problems. Through APBioNetTalks, we hope to contribute to bridge this gap by providing an open access video-based bioinformatics learning resources for the community.

## **How to Get Involved** 
**Let us know what you think:** share your thoughts on our services via [email](secretariat@apbionet.org), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/APBioNetorg) or [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/apbionet). 
**Become a supporting member:** be a part of Asia Pacific bioinformatics community. Find out more about us on our [website](http://www.apbionet.org/). 
**Share your expertise:** if you are passionate about sharing bioinformatics-related expertise and skills to the community, we welcome you to contribute a talk/demo/tutorial/workshop to APBioNetTalks. Please help complete this [form](https://forms.gle/SAVsiaLFCidhykY8A), which would capture all the relevant information we need. You can make multiple submissions if you are keen to contribute more. 
**Chair a Session:** If you are interested in being a moderator for a talk/demo/workshop, please fill this [form](https://forms.gle/7DnKHPLEaf4Ko6pU8). 

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring platform for all. Please follow our [code of conduct](https://apbtalks.apbionet.org/code-of-conduct/) in all kind of activities related to APBioNetTalks.

## *Upcoming Activities*

### Revolutionising genome analysis with machine learning and cloud computing
**December 15, 2020, 1-2 pm SGT**

***Dr Natalie Twine, Transformational Bioinformatics Group, CSIRO*** 

Dr. Natalie Twine provides an insider’s view into the development of a Spark-based machine learning framework that is able to find disease genes in the 3 billion letters of the genome. She will also cover novel software, TRIBES, developed to uncover distant relatives based on their genome. Knowing relationship status is important for diagnosing and treating genetic diseases. Natalie will showcase how the technology has been used to understand and find treatments for motor neurone disease. Finally, Natalie will showcase hot-off-the-press cloud-native technology where CSIRO have advanced the COVID-19 response through digital health. 

**Bio:** 
Dr Natalie Twine is team lead of the Genome Insights team at CSIRO who focus on developing technology for population-scale genomics. Dr Twine’s research career to date has focused on translational and clinical genomics and she is passionate about using technology to impact health and understand complex disease. Dr Twine thrives on collaborative research and collaborates with Macquarie University, the International Project MinE consortium and others. Her publication record is strong, with 26 peer-reviewed publications, over 1030 citations and h-index of 14. Dr Twine has presented at numerous international conferences including ISMB 2019 (Switzerland) and MND Symposium 2019 (Perth). She obtained her PhD in Bioinformatics from University of New South Wales and has previously worked at UNSW, Kings College London and University College London.
