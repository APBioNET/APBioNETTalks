**Highlight:**
Our fourth APBioNETTalks took place on June 17, 2021 entitled “Why social media matters for research now more than ever” and was delivered by Michelle Mendonca of EMBL-EBI. In this talk, we learned from Michelle’s experience as the Digital Strategy Officer at EMBL-EBI on the advantages of social media in science and research communication. More and more researchers and research institutions have turned to social media to build their brand and promote their research. Michelle also provided an example on how social media can be used to build a successful research community. She shared some “dos and don’ts” in using social media to build a strong digital presence.
